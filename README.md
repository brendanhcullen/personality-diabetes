# personality-diabetes
This project uses data from the [SAPA Project](https://sapa-project.org/research/) to investigate the relationship between personality and diabetes. The data are available on [Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/SAPA-Project). 

Simulated diabetes data was used in conjunction with a dataset from December 2015-February 2017 (version 2.1) as a placeholder in order to create preliminary analysis scripts (Condon et al., 2017).
